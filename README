This project is an implementation of an RPC using a udp framework.
We used the UDP to implement a RPC like handshake mechanism, with the server sending acknowledgement when it recieves on going requests. 
The files that we worked on are : Client.c and Server.c. 
Interfaces regarding the basic functionality we were required to implement were provided to us. 
The format of sending and recieving the packets is explained in the comments of the respective files( since server and client) send and recieve different types of packages.
